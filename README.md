Where the Party App? is designed to address a centuries old problem for humanity:  Why am I finding myself at this terrible bar / restaurant?  And where are all of my friends?  What is the cause of this dreadful paradigm?  Where lies the seat of my morose?

This answer to these questions are relatively simple.  Human beings are creatures of habit.  We aim to break those habits.

By accessing the excellent Yelp! Fusion API our app enables users to search for nightlife options available near them. Bars & Restaurants can the be added by users to an itinerary which can then be shared with friends.  So when you next ask yourself, "Where the party app?"; boot up our site.  Then you will know!
